# high-frequency-checks
A Stata template for high frequency checks of field data at Innovations for Poverty Action

## Daily Checks

   1. ~~Check that all interviews were completed~~
   2. ~~Check that there are no duplicate observations~~
   3. ~~Check that all surveys have consent~~
   4. ~~Check that certain critical variables have no missing values~~
   5. ~~Check that follow up record ids match original~~
   6. Check skip patterns and constraints
   7. ~~Check that no variable has all missing values~~
   8. ~~Check hard/soft constraints~~
   9. ~~Check specify other vars for items that can be included~~
   10. ~~Check that date values fall within survey range~~
   11. ~~Check that there are no outliers for unconstrained vars~~
   12. Check that survey and section durations fall within limits

## Enumerator Dashboards

   1. Check the percentage of “don’t know” and “refusal” values for each variable by enumerator
   2. Check the percentage giving each answer for key filter questions by enumerator
   3. Check the percentage of survey refusals by enumerator
   4. Check the number of surveys per day by enumerator
   5. Check average interview duration by enumerator
   6. Check the duration of consent by enumerator
   7. Check the duration of other (anthropometrics, games, etc)

## Research Dashboards

   1. Survey progress towards recruitment goals.
   2. Summary of key research variables.
   3. Two way summaries of survey variables by demographic/geographic characteristics.
   4. Refusal/not found rates by treatment status.
   5. Maps/GIS
