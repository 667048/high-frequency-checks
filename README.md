# high-frequency-checks
A Stata template for high frequency checks of field data at Innovations for Poverty Action

## Daily Checks

 - [x] 1. Check that all interviews were completed
 - [x] 2. Check that there are no duplicate observations
 - [x] 3. Check that all surveys have consent
 - [x] 4. Check that certain critical variables have no missing values
 - [x] 5. Check that follow up record ids match original
 - [ ] 6. Check skip patterns and constraints
 - [x] 7. Check that no variable has all missing values
 - [x] 8. Check hard/soft constraints
 - [x] 9. Check specify other vars for items that can be included
 - [x] 10. Check that date values fall within survey range
 - [x] 11. Check that there are no outliers for unconstrained vars
 - [ ] 12. Check that survey and section durations fall within limits

## Enumerator Dashboards

 - [x] 1. Check the percentage of “don’t know” and “refusal” values for each variable by enumerator
 - [x] 2. Check the percentage giving each answer for key filter questions by enumerator
 - [ ] 3. Check the percentage of survey refusals by enumerator
 - [ ] 4. Check the number of surveys per day by enumerator
 - [x] 5. Check average interview duration by enumerator
 - [x] 6. Check the duration of consent by enumerator
 - [x] 7. Check the duration of other (anthropometrics, games, etc)

## Research Dashboards

 - [ ] 1. Survey progress towards recruitment goals.
 - [ ] 2. Summary of key research variables.
 - [ ] 3. Two way summaries of survey variables by demographic/geographic characteristics.
 - [ ] 4. Refusal/not found rates by treatment status.
 - [ ] 5. Maps/GIS
